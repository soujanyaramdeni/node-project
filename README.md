## Node Farm Project



# Overview
The Node Farm project is a simple Node.js application designed to demonstrate the basics of creating a web server, handling routing, reading data from files, and rendering HTML templates dynamically. 
This project is an excellent starting point for understanding core Node.js concepts and building a foundational knowledge of server-side JavaScript development.

# Features
->Web Server: Built using the Node.js http module.
->Routing: Handles different URL paths to serve various pages or content.
->File Reading: Reads data from the filesystem to fetch dynamic content.
->Template Rendering: Uses basic string replacement to render HTML pages with dynamic data.
->Environment Setup: Basic setup using package.json and required dependencies.
